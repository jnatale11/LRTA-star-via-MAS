# Learning Real-Time A* Search via a Multi-agent System. 
Designed multi-threaded solution in Java to path finding problem utilizing LRTA*(n), an asynchronous algorithm in which "n" threads access a shared dynamic data structure of heuristic values. Implemented locking mechanisms to avoid race conditions and synchronized thread trials for consistent representation through GUI.
